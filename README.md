# Anscombe Quartet Dataset

The Anscombe Quartet Dataset consists of four datasets that have nearly identical
descriptive statistics but very different charts.  
It was created by 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to show (among others) the 
importance of using graphics/charts in data analysis.  

In this small example I show how to use Pandas, Plotly and Streamlit to do a 
quick EDA on the Anscombe Quartett.  

You can read more about Francis Anscombe and his dataset on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet).
